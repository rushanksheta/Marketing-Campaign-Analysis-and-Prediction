## Problem Statement
To classify if a new customer will respond positively or negatively towards the next product based on responses taken while a previously conducted marketing campaign. Marketing campaign analysis allows companies to find customers which are highly likely to become future customers this can be done either by data analysis or classification models. We will use both, firstly we try various plots to see if we can generate some insights using data visualization then train classifier models to make predictions given the input attribute including customer demographics like age, income, marital status, account balance, gender, occupation, last campaign results, no of times contacted, etc.
